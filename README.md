# **Coffee_Machine_Python**
## **For a professional coffee machine with its multiplicity of products and its many configuration possibilities, 
user interface languages and maintenance options to be operated easily a full graphical, 
touch based user interface is necessary. This results in a complex control system, 
which gets even more complex through the many dependencies from the hardware and especially from the mechanics of the machine.

# Object-Oriented Programming | The Coffee Machine Project (revisited)
### This is an Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) version of the "Coffee Machine Project" from Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp, from the London App Brewery. You can find the other version (non-OOP) in this author's other repository.

## If you are studying programming paradigms, here's a suggestion: compare both projects (OOP and non-OOP).

### Project Requirements
### Here's what this project requires:

 [x] Prompt user by asking "what would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): "
 [x] Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering "off" to the prompt.
 [x] Print report.
 [x] Check if resources are sufficient.
 [x] Process coins.
 [x] Check if transaction is successful.
 [x] Make coffee.
